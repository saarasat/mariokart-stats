# Future development

1. Other Mario Karts: The app could include an admin-role in addition to user-role. That would enable adding tracks and characters so that it could be used for other Mario Kart -games.

2. Adding multiple players to the same race: This would enable the comparison of stats of the same gaming session.

3. Adding global ranking: This would enable comparing your (players') results to others registered in the app.

4. Counting points: Mario Kart has a point system integrated which defines the winners of GPs. This could be added to the races-table so that not only placement would be counted.

5. Grouping races on GPs or cups: Mario Kart is usually played in a GP (a cup) of four races. This sort of grouping could be added.
