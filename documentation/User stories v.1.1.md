# User stories

The idea is that anyone can update racing statistics from Mario Kart 64. The person (scorekeeper) can be either the player themselves, or a someone who keeps the score players playing the game. The concept “race” includes the performance of one player in one track. That way the app can contain either the statistics of only one player who wants to follow his progress or for instance the results of a group of friends playing the game.
